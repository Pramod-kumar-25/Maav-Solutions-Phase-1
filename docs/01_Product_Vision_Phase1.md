# Product Vision: MaaV Solutions Phase-1 (Non-AI)

## 1. Overview
MaaV Solutions Phase-1 is the foundational "Body" of a future AI-driven tax optimization platform. In this phase, we are building a robust, deterministic, and compliance-focused Digital Tax Assistant. This system serves as the immutable backbone for user data management, tax rule execution, and filing orchestration.

## 2. Core Strategy: "The Body Before The Brain"
Before introducing Artificial Intelligence (the "Brain"), we must perfect the "Body"—the infrastructure that handles data ingestion, storage, processing, and rule validation.
- **Determinism**: Every output must be traceable to a specific input and rule.
- **Reliability**: The system must function as a System of Record (SoR) for taxpayer data.
- **Structure**: Data must be structured perfectly to facilitate future AI layer integration without refactoring.

## 3. Human-in-the-Loop Philosophy
Phase-1 operates on a strict **Human-in-the-Loop (HITL)** principle.
- **No Automatic Execution**: The system proposes; the User confirms.
- **Explicit Consent**: Data retrieval and sharing require explicit, audit-logged consent.
- **Verification**: Critical actions (e.g., finalizing a tax computation, submitting a filing) require active user confirmation (Digital Signature or OTP equivalent simulation).

## 4. Scope & Constraints
### In Scope
- **User Management**: Secure authentication and role management (Individual, Business, CA).
- **Data Ingestion**: Structured recording of Income (AIS, Bank) and Expenses.
- **Rule Engine**: Deterministic tax calculation and compliance checks.
- **Filing Workflow**: State-machine driven filing process tracking.

### Out of Scope (Phase-1)
- **Generative AI**: No LLMs for advisory or interaction.
- **Automated Filing**: No direct integration with Government ERI portals.
- **Payment Processing**: No payment gateways.
- **Complex ITRs**: Exclusion of ITR-3 and ITR-4 complex business scenarios.

## 5. AI Status in Phase-1 (Explicitly Disabled)
**CRITICAL ARCHITECTURAL MANDATE:**

- **AI features are intentionally disabled in Phase-1.**
- **No AI-based decision making is allowed.** The system must rely 100% on deterministic code.
- **No predictive or probabilistic logic is permitted.** If an outcome is not certain based on the inputs and hard-coded rules, the system must defer to the user.
- **All compliance logic must be deterministic and rule-based.** Tax laws are treated as absolute rules, not suggestions generated by a model.
- **Human-in-the-loop confirmation is mandatory.** No "smart" automation can bypass user verification.
- **Any AI capability is reserved for a future Phase-2 advisory layer.** DO NOT implement "pre-work" for AI that violates Phase-1 safety or determinism.
- **Introducing AI into Phase-1 without architectural review is prohibited.** Any attempt to add LLM calls, ML models, or heuristic guessing will be rejected.
